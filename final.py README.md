# Image-Manipulation-Program
This assignment was completed for the CPS109 - Computer Science 1 course, that taught me about using the numpy and pillow libraries to perform image manipulation using arrays. The result is an interactive program that asks user for input and has a testing image in the folder that performs operations to the image based on users input.
The file final.py is the final version of the file. 
Name of file to be opened: 'testimage.jpg'
Must be in same directory (folder) as the final.py file.
Run program using: 'python final.py'
and follow on screen user input to navigate the program.
Enjoy!
