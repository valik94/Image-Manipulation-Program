Assignment 1 - part2- Threshold





Pseudocode
def Userinput ()function
input is image
asks user to enter options for selection
while choice!='q'
if option 1:
	function1
if option 2:
	function2
else: 
	to quit press 'q'


def Reflection function:
takes in an image
turns image to gray scale ('L')
ask user for input on reflection percentage (up to 50)
user asked for input on reflection type (vertical - v or horizontal-h)
REFLECTION: 
convert image to arrayimage
mirroring the values of each pixel along axis
performed on index by index manipulation of rows and columns 
use numpy array manipulation (Can't use Pillow)
show new reflect image via image.show()
return numpy array of modified image





def Threshold function
input is unmodified grayscale image
ask for user input
change value of image pixels to either 0 or 255 based on input
pixel value=0 if input <=255
pixel value >0 if input>255
return numpyarray of modified image
